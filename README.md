# Recipe JSON Processing With C# - University Assignment

This repository contains my solution for the **Computing Lab 3** course assignment (2022/2023). The task involved implementing a program that processes and manipulates recipes stored in JSON format.

## Assignment Overview
The goal of the assignment was to develop a program that allows a cook to create and modify recipes programmatically. Recipes are stored as JSON documents, and the program supports:

- Storing and retrieving recipes from JSON files.
- Combining multiple recipes.
- Modifying ingredient quantities.
- Handling nested structures within recipes.
- Resolving references to external recipe files.
